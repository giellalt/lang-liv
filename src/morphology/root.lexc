!! !!!INTRODUCTION TO THE MORPHOLOGICAL ANALYSER OF LIVONIAN.


Multichar_Symbols

!! Analysis of the symbols symbols
!! ----------------

!! The morphological analyses of wordforms in Livonian are presented
!! in this system in terms of following symbols.

!! (It is highly suggested to follow existing GIELLATEKNO standards when adding new tags).

+TYÄ !!= * @CODE@ = This automatically encourages workers to want to correct something

!! !!The parts-of-speech are:
 +A 	 !!= * @CODE@ = adjective

!! !!!Morphophonology
! ---------------

!! To represent phonologic variations in word forms we use the following
!! symbols in the lexicon files:

 {aä} {oö} {uü} !!= @CODE@

!! And following triggers to control variation
 {front} {back} !!= * @CODE@
 %^Tense !!= * @CODE@ = Tense stem will have stød if proper stem type
 %^ConsL !!= * @CODE@ = Consonant lengthening
 %^1Sh2L !!= * @CODE@ =

 %^ConsSh
 %^Stress1to2  !!= * @CODE@ =
 %^Stress2to1  !!= * @CODE@ =

!! We have manually optimised the structure of our lexicon using following
!! flag diacritics to restrict morhpological combinatorics:
